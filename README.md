# 🏛️ Beis Hamikdash Destruction Memory Popup

Add a meaningful popup on all websites to remind us of the destruction of the Temple. This project adds a solemn reminder to any page you visit, ensuring we never forget.

## 🚀 Installation

To use this popup, you’ll need to install the [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) browser extension (if you haven’t already). You can then either:

1. **Download** the script file from this repository.
2. **Copy** the code directly and create a new Tampermonkey script.

## ✨ How to Add the Script

1. Open Tampermonkey in your browser.
2. Click on `Create a new script`.
3. Paste the code from this project or the downloaded file.
4. Save the script and you’re good to go! 🎉

## ❓ How Does It Work?

When the popup appears, simply **click** on it to close it. This ensures that the reminder is subtle and doesn’t interrupt your browsing experience for too long. 🖱️
